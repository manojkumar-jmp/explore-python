# Python Learning Path for AI & ML

This step-by-step learning path io build a strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) using Python.

---

## 1. Python Fundamentals
- Variables, data types (int, float, str, bool)
- Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
- Control flow: `if`, `for`, `while`
- Functions, arguments, return values
- Modules and imports
- Practice: Write simple scripts, calculators, and control flow exercises.

---

## 2. Data Structures
- Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- List comprehensions
- Slicing and basic operations
- Practice: Manipulate collections, write data parsing scripts.

---

## 3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and objects
- Methods, attributes
- Inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism
- Practice: Model real-world objects (e.g., Animal, Vehicle).

---

## 4. Essential Libraries
- **NumPy**: Arrays, broadcasting, vectorized operations
- **Pandas**: DataFrames, Series, I/O, filtering, grouping
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Plotting, histograms, scatter plots
- Practice: Manipulate and visualize small datasets.

---

## 5. Data Manipulation & Cleaning
- Reading/writing data (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Handling missing values, outliers
- Data transformation: scaling, encoding, normalization
- Practice: Clean a messy dataset and prepare it for analysis.

---

## 6. Data Visualization
- Plotting distributions, trends, and relationships
- Customizing plots
- Practice: Visualize real datasets (e.g., Iris, Titanic).

---

## 7. Statistics & Probability (with Python)
- Mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation
- Probability distributions (normal, binomial, etc.)
- Correlation, covariance
- Practice: Analyze data samples and distributions.

---

## 8. Machine Learning Concepts (with scikit-learn)
- Supervised vs. unsupervised learning
- Regression (linear, logistic)
- Classification (SVM, k-NN, decision trees)
- Clustering (K-means, hierarchical)
- Model evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC
- Practice: Build and evaluate ML models on small datasets.

---

## 9. Feature Engineering
- Encoding categorical variables (one-hot, label)
- Feature selection, extraction
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
- Practice: Improve model performance with better features.

---

## 10. Model Deployment (Basics)
- Saving/loading models (pickle, joblib)
- Introduction to Flask/FastAPI for simple API deployment
- Practice: Deploy a trained model as an API.

---

## 11. Introduction to Deep Learning
- Neural networks basics (perceptrons, activation functions)
- Using TensorFlow or PyTorch to build simple models
- Introduction to CNNs, RNNs
- Practice: Train a simple neural network on image or text data.
